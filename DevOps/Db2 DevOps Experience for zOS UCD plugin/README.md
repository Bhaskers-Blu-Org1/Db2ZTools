**IBM Db2 DevOps Experience for z/OS**

Db2 DevOps Experience allows organizations to bring applications to
market more rapidly, at lower cost and with less risk. Db2 DevOps
Experience helps Db2 for z/OS application development teams to implement
DevOps practices by automating and standardizing tasks that would
normally require interaction with an operations team. It provides
collaboration between roles in an organization. Developers can easily
provision a version of an application, make changes, test, and promote
those changes for approval. Quality Engineers can easily automate the
creation of Db2 test environments to speed and improve testing
activities. Administrators can set the site rules for Db2 schema
standards, review and approval of changes, and usage rules. These
practices speed development time, improve quality, and integrate better
into multi-platform development practices.

The Db2 DevOps Experience plug-in includes steps to provision,
deprovision, analyze, apply, promote and sync up.
